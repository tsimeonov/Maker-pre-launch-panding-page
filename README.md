# Maker pre-launch landing page

## Overview

### The challenge

Build out this pre-launch landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! That doesnâ€™t look like an email address"
